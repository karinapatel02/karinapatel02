### **Hi there, I'm Karina** 👋

## I am a Data Scientist

An analytical and results-driven professional with a Master’s in Computer Science and a deep passion for data. I love transforming complex datasets into meaningful insights, with hands-on experience in machine learning, NLP, and statistical analysis. My work has created tangible business impact—such as driving 15Cr+ savings for an enterprise client—while fueling my curiosity to keep learning and experimenting.

I bring strong skills in Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI, and model deployment, backed by a solid foundation in software engineering and object-oriented programming. I thrive in fast-paced environments, enjoy solving problems creatively, and love translating data into stories that drive decisions and innovation.

🚀 Open to collaborating on cutting-edge, data-driven projects that challenge conventional thinking.
☕ Always up for good coffee conversations!
An ambitious, dedicated, and diligent person who is always learning something new.
